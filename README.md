# MachineLearning1

The project contains my first deep learning drafts.

1. The first dl recognises numbers, based on dense layers

2. The second dl calculates the possible price of a machine suitable for the market

3. The third dl recongnises cars, based on dense and conv layers

4. The forth dl guesses the author's text, based on Bow layer

5. This section compares the effectiveness of different dl on the same base (BoW, Embending, Lstm, Conv1D)

6. This machine is designed to calculate the salary of employees in relation to the market.

7. This machine predicts future site visit statistics (does not work due to the small number of items in the database)

8. Determining the genre of the composition

9. Autoencoder. Recovering an image in which one quarter has been deleted
