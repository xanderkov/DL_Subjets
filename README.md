# MachineLearning1

The project contains my first deep learning drafts.

1. The first dl recognises numbers, based on dense layers

2. The second dl calculates the possible price of a machine suitable for the market

3. The third dl recongnises cars, based on dense and conv layers

4. The forth dl guesses the author's text, based on Bow layer

5. This section compares the effectiveness of different dl on the same base (BoW, Embending, Lstm, Conv1D)
